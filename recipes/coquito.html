    <h1>Coquito</h1>
    <img src="../images/coquito.jpg" alt="Image of Coquito dish" height="310" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a festive beverage from Puerto Rico that is creamy, tropical, and bursting with coconut flavour. Condensed and evaporated milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and, in this variation, egg yolks are the ingredients. At my holiday parties, people always ask for it.</p>
    <p>I occasionally keep it for myself by hiding it in the refrigerator! If desired, top with additional cinnamon and serve in glass cups. Happy Navidad!
    </p>
