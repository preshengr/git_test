    <h1>Coquito</h1>
    <img src="../images/coquito.jpg" alt="Image of Coquito dish" height="310" width="310">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a festive beverage from Puerto Rico that is creamy, tropical, and bursting with coconut flavour. Condensed and evaporated milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and, in this variation, egg yolks are the ingredients. At my holiday parties, people always ask for it.</p>
    <p>I occasionally keep it for myself by hiding it in the refrigerator! If desired, top with additional cinnamon and serve in glass cups. Happy Navidad!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>½ cup white rum</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; blend until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator; serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
