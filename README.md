# Recipes for Odin

Welcome to the library of **Odin Recipes**! ðŸŽ‰


This project is a component of my education through the Odin Project curriculum's **Foundations course**. It focusses on developing a strong grasp of **HTML** through the creation of a basic recipe website. With this effort, I hope to improve my abilities in:

- Web material is organised using **HTML tags** and elements.
Dealing with **void elements** and how to use them correctly.
Enhancing web elements with the addition and modification of **attributes**.

Building a useful and aesthetically pleasing website while learning the principles of HTML is made possible by this practical project. As I continue to advance in my web development career, stay tuned for updates!
